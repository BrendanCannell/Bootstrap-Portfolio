# Bootstrap-Portfolio

I started off using Bootstrap with vanilla CSS to recreate the layout, but the practice of sprinkling styling information across the HTML, often repeating myself, drove me absolutely crazy. So I learned about Sass and incorporated Bootstrap into my own stylesheet via @extend and @include expressions.

But the assignment isn't terribly grid-like, and Bootstrap's components never do quite what you want and using the cascade to override them drives me crazy, and the (non-responsive) utility classes are kind of pointless when building the site this way. So ultimately I wound up with code that only uses a little bit of Bootstrap. Basically just enough to avoid media queries.

 I think I will find Bootstrap most useful as a prototyping tool.
