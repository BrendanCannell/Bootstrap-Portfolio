# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The plain-CSS way of using Bootstrap by sprinkling (often duplicated) styling information across the HTML drives me absolutely crazy. I understand that Bootstrap can be used with SASS and a build process to avoid this problem, but I couldn't bring myself to learn all that just now. So I used as little Bootstrap as I could while fulfilling the specification. Basically just the navbar and form components, and some responsive layout classes so as to avoid media queries.
