                <p>I was born on May 5th, 1988. I stand 6'3" tall and weigh 180 lbs, with blue eyes and pale skin. My
                    middle
                    name is Phillip. I was born on May 5th, 1988. I stand 6'3" tall and weigh 180 lbs, with blue eyes
                    and pale skin. My middle

                <p>By day, I'm a mild-mannered computer programming student. I like math, science, and long walks on
                    the
                    beach. But by night... <em>I fight crime!</em></p>
